            <p><img src="assets/images/cjal_ppix.jpg" alt="Colin Larkin">
            Colin Larkin is an American and a Philadelphian. His affection for town and
            country notwithstanding, however, Colin enjoys crossing international borders 
            nearly as often as his cosmopolitan brother. 

            <br><br>
            
            Colin's first overseas journey to the beautiful island of Jamaica took place
            when he was just four years old. Photos from the trip tell us Colin had an early 
            fascination with numbers. Arguably the most memorable image from his Caribbean 
            adventure depicts a young Colin proudly clutching a table sign of the number "100" 
            from the restaurant at the hotel where he stayed with his beloved parents Marie and 
            the late James. And though surely too young to grasp binary, the devilish glint in 
            Colin's eye suggests he just might have known his own age was the same as the number 
            on that sign.

            <br><br>

            Colin wouldn't go abroad again until his teens, when he saw the Old World
            for the first time in the capital of the empire against whom some early hometown 
            Philly dudes once pledged their lives, fortunes and sacred honors just down the street 
            from where Colin current resides. And even after some cheeky Druids made off with 
            his asthma inhaler at Stonehenge, Colin found England to be a jolly good time indeed.
