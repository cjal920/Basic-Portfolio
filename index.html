            Colin Larkin was born in Philadelphia and is still proud to call it home. 
            And while the city bordering New Jersey to its west may have lost some of 
            its sense of identity and importance as the great island city to its north
            grew mighty during the last century, Philadelphia, in recent years, has
            begun to give New York - the metropolis that his admirable younger brother
            now calls home - a run for its money. 

            <br><br>

            As much as he loves his city and his country, Colin also enjoys to cross
            international borders as often as his busy schedule permits. His first 
            overseas journey was to Jamaica. And though too young at the time to 
            clearly remember the Caribbean, photos from the trip tell us he had a 
            wonderful time with his mother and father. 

            <br><br>

            Colin wouldn't go abroad again until his teens, when he saw the old world
            for the first time in the nation whose king once gave his subjects in
            Philly such a hard time for pledging their lives, fortunes and sacred honor
            to get the hell away from him. But because he doesn't believe in holding
            grudges, not to mention the fact that none of his ancestors would even come 
            to America a good century after Jefferson published his Declaration just down 
            the street from his current abode, Colin enjoyed England splendidly (even after 
            losing the inhaler for his asthma at Stonehenge).
