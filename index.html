            <p><img src="assets/images/cjal_ppix.jpg" alt="Colin Larkin">
            Colin Larkin is an American and a Philadelphian. His affection for town and
            country notwithstanding, however, Colin enjoys crossing international borders 
            nearly as often as his cosmopolitan brother. 

            <br><br>
            
            Colin's first overseas journey to the beautiful island of Jamaica took place
            when he was just four years old. Photos from the trip tell us Colin had an early 
            fascination with numbers. Arguably the most memorable image from his Caribbean 
            adventure depicts a young Colin proudly clutching a table sign of the number "100" 
            from the restaurant at the hotel where he stayed with his beloved parents Marie and 
            the late James. And though surely too young to grasp binary, the devilish glint in 
            Colin's eye suggests he just might have known his own age was the same as the number 
            on the sign.

            <br><br>

            Colin wouldn't go abroad again until his teens, when he saw the Old World
            for the first time in the nation against whom some early hometown dudes once
            pledged their lives, fortunes and sacred honors just down the street from the 
            address Colin now calls home. Colin thoroughly enjoyed England &#8212; even after 
            some cheeky Druid spirits made off with his asthma inhaler at Stonehenge &#8212; and 
            looks forward to returning. But probably not before revisiting his mother's side of the 
            family with her in Italy.
